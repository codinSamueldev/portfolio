# Is it necessary to give a description in regards of a portfolio?
Anyways, it is a short-detailed portfolio of projects I have done so you can take a look and if you want to provide constructive feedback, please shoot your best shot ðŸ“§
Lastly, I would like to say this is not my definitive portfolio since I want to create one more robust but, practice creates mastery right?
